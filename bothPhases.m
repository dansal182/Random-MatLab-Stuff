% This algorithm implements the simplex method for a problem of the type
% max c^T x subject to Ax=b.
% To do this, we first use the phase 1 algorithm to check if the problem
% is feasible, and solve an auxiliary program to obtain an initial basic
% feasible solution and its feasible basis.
% We then use this basic feasible solution and the feasible basis to 
% implement the regular simplex method, using Bland's Rule as the pivoting
% method to avoid cycling.
% 
% In case the feasible set is empty, all the outputs besides status are
% set to NaN (Not a Number):
% If the problem is feasible but unbounded, the optimal value is set to Inf
% and the other outputs excluding status are set to NaN.
